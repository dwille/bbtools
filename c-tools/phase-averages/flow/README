PURPOSE:
Calculates phase-averaged fluid velocity at each timestep

CONFIG
  -- Sets the starting and ending time to reconstruct

PLOT
  -- confidence
    -- simple linear regression with confidence bounds on input data
  -- fit_all
    -- Plots n,k from R-Z relation with confidence bounds and also R-Z relation
  -- plot_all
    -- plots <w_f> against rho and nparts
  -- plot_avg
    -- Plots <w_f>(t) (and u and v) against time so that a mean can be taken at
        steady state
