PURPOSE:
Phase averaged particle velocity over time. Also variance, sdev

CONFIG
  -- Sets the starting and ending time to reconstruct

PLOT (these are messy, my apologies. Haven't spent much time on them)
  -- 3d_plot_flucts
    -- plots velocity fluctuations as function of Galileo number and vfrac
  -- hinch_high_rey
    -- compares velocity fluctuations to some theory by hinch
  -- plot_all
    -- plots velocity flucations as a function of phi, also dwdphi
  -- plot_avg
    -- plots relative velocity of particle and fluid
  -- raw_flucts
    -- flucts non normalized
  -- variance
    -- plots variance of velocity components
