PURPOSE:
Track tetrads of particle throughout time and calculate some cute statistics on
them

CONFIG
  -- Sets the starting and ending time to reconstruct
  -- Initial size and tolerances
  -- Multiple runs (for ensembling)
  -- Output raw data (if ensembling, don't need to) (Actually, don't really 
      need to at all, ever)

PLOT (some of these are old and not very fleshed out, marked with a *)
* -- Plots alignment, sometimes from raw data
  -- all_align{*}
    -- Plot alignment statistics of all cases
  -- all_shape{*}
    -- Plot shape statistics  of all cases
  -- all_pdf
*   -- Outputs some pdfs?
  -- combine_runs_*
    -- Ensemble average runs together
* -- lyapunov_exp
    -- of the RoG scaling?
* -- mean_measures
    -- pdf over time? for one case?
  -- ternary
    -- ternary diagram of normalized eigenvalues I_k
* -- tetrad_regulariy
    -- plot pdfs at initial condition
