PURPOSE:
Calculates the pair-distribution function in various ways. Truly, the best way
to expand this would be a Hankel transform, which I haven't attemped yet. The
boundary conditions are g(r=0) = 0, g(r->infty) = 1. I've also heard chebyshev
or some other fancy polynomial in r would work (they use it in mol. dyn.)

CONFIG:
  -- Start an end time
  -- Distance to look for pairs
  -- Bin size or reconstruction parameters
  -- For 3d-hist_bins, greater than or less than a certain number of sdevs from
      mean

3d-hist_bins:
  Tries to conditionally average the pair distribution function based on the
  volume fraction. Uses a histogram.
bins
  Simple histogram way to calculate it.
fourier
  Expand r in fourier series. Might work with fancy padding, but otherwise
  boundary conditions are getting in the way
laguerre
  Expand r in laguerre polynomials.
r-fourier
  Expands rg(r) instead of g(r)
solid
  Expands g(r) in solid harmonics
