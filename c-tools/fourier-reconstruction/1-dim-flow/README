PURPOSE:
Calculates the Fourier reconstruction of the flow velocites using fftw in one
dimension (i.e., cross-plane wavenumbers, x & y, are set to 0)

CONFIG
  -- Sets the starting and ending time to reconstruct
  -- Sets the number of terms to keep in the reconstruction
  -- Sets whether or not to output the coefficients of the expansion at each
      timestep. Useful if we want to investigate the coefficients

PLOT
  -- Plots the reconstructed flow velocities as a spatio-temporal plot
