PURPOSE:
Calculates the Fourier reconstruction of the particle phase quantities in one
dimension (i.e., cross-plane wavenumbers, x & y, are set to 0). These include
number density, volume fraction, velocity components, and kinetic energy.
This does NOT use fftw, since there's a pretty nice analytic expression as 
particles can be expressed as the sum of Heaviside / delta functions and some
integrals are eliminated.

CONFIG
  -- Sets the starting and ending time to reconstruct
  -- Sets the number of terms to keep in the reconstruction
  -- Sets whether or not to output the coefficients of the expansion at each
      timestep. Useful if we want to investigate the coefficients

SUBMISSION
  -- batch-submission: submit all to a slurm queue, they run in serial
  -- submit-parallel: submit all to slurm, they run in parallel

PLOT
  -- surface.py: 
       Plots the reconstructed flow velocities as a spatio-temporal plot
  -- autocorrelate-{space,time}:
       Autocorrelations in space and time to get frequencies and wavelengths
  -- avg-{crosscorr,plot}-spacetime, avg:
       Correlation of time slices and averaging, used to get wavespeed
  -- avg-waveform: (DEVEL)
       Tries to average together waveforms based on maxima cross-correlations.
  -- coeffs{,_field_compare}:
       Plot the reconstruction coefficients to examine their magnitude
  -- correlate_two_fields:
       Tries to correlate different reconstructed fields together
  -- crosscorrelate-spacetime:
       Precursor to the averaged version
  -- fluct_{magnitude,stat_dependence}:
       Tries to find fluctuation magnitude based on probability levels or
       standard deviation. Also plots these as a function of reconstruction 
       order
  -- histogram_vfrac_vel:
       Bivariate histogram of velocity and volume fraction
  -- power-spectrum-{space,time}:
       Power spectrum of the reconstruction in space and time, useful for 
       finding strongest component of frequency and wavelength
  -- radon_{plot,transform}:
       Apply radon transform to spatio-temporal field and plot. Used to find
       wavespeed, but not as clear as the correlation analysis
  -- slices:
       Plot various slices of the spatio-temporal field to give visuals how we
       find wavespeed
  -- submission:
       Various ways to submit different plotting utils across all simulations
  -- vfrac_wp_correlation:
       Compares velocity fluctuations across volume fractions
  -- wavespeed:
       Plot wavespeeds as function of volume fraction
