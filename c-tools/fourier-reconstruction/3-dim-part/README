PURPOSE:
Calculates the Fourier reconstruction of the part velocites and KE using fftw in
3 dimensions.

CONFIG
  -- Sets the starting and ending time to reconstruct
  -- Sets the number of terms to keep in the reconstruction in all dimensions

TRACK_WAVES
Using the wavespeed calculated in 1-dim, sweeps an averaging box through at
that speed and averages a little over the z-direction. Trying to see if the 
wave structures persist, or whether they are composed of the same particles or
not.

CONFIG
  -- Starting and ending time
  -- Initial location of plane
  -- Total width of box (vertical direction, in particle units)
  -- Part radius
  -- Wavespeed (or sweep velocity
