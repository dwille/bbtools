This is a collection of tools meant to be used for analysis of disperse multiphase results from Bluebottle simulations.
Feel free to use and modify these under the terms of the Apache License included in this folder.
The most useful way to use the tools is to probably create a fork of this repository and work on it there.
If there are any bugs or additions you feel would be useful to any users, please create a pull request.
